# CS-FinalProject
Final Project for the UCLA Extension Cybersecurity Bootcamp

## Overview
You are working as a Security Engineer for X-CORP, supporting the SOC infrastructure. The SOC analysts have noticed some discrepancies with alerting in the Kibana system and the manager has asked the Security Engineering team to investigate.
To start, your team needs to confirm that newly created alerts are working. Once the alerts are verified to be working, you will monitor live traffic on the wire to detect any abnormalities that aren't reflected in the alerting system.
You will then report back all your findings to both the SOC manager and the Engineering Manager with appropriate analysis.
